## Where to Start
- Know who the software is targeted to
	- Interview your customers (Market Research)
- Brainstorm
- Observation on Similar Systems, and Interactions with them
- Find the hidden, more process oriented requirements
- Prototyping
- Use Case


## Use Cases
A written description of a user interaction with the system to accomplish a particular goal
- Might also be referred to as a *story*
- End goal is to have a series of written steps (Generally 3-9 steps)
- Written from the POV of the *actor*, or the person interfacing with the system
	- A success scenario (the usual case, what is expected)
	- An extension scenario (what happens when something goes wrong)
- A list of goals can be pulled from the use case

### Defining an Extension Scenario
*Ex:*
- A cache system tries to find an item within the cache
- The item isn't there -- what happens next?
- The item does not exist -- what happens next?

### Creating a Use Case
4 Steps:
1) Identify actors and goals
2) What is the success scenario
3) What are the extension scenarios
	- What are the *failure* scenarios
4) Variations
	- How should we modify the success scenario when things go wrong?

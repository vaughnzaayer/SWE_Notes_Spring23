Does not fit nicely into [[Agile Development]] or [[Plan and Process-Driven Development]] 

## Main Ideas
- You do not write *production code* except to make a *test pass*
	- Writing code is ok, just not code that will be in the final product

- Make the simplest change change to make your test case pass

- Refactor to remove duplication

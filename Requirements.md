## Requirements Document
[[The Requirements Document]]
- a.k.a *Software Design Specification*


### What's important?
- Clear list of what the customer actually wants
	- How do we get to each part of the customer's desires?
	- How do they interact?
- Where is the boundary between design and requirements?

### Goals
*See:* [[How to Generate Requirements]]
#### Intuition
- List of everything the program needs to do (what's the end goal?)
	- Test completion
- Prerequisites
- Illustrate the customer's vision
	- What are the specifics?
	- Make things concrete and realizable
- Organized granularity
	- No hidden requirements!
	- Remove assumptions
- Specify inputs/outputs
- "Don't let perfect be the enemy good"

#### Official
- Understand what is required of the software
	- Precision is crucial
	- Remove assumptions
- Communicate the understanding to all involved parties
	- Different parties need different things
- Control the process to ensure that the system focuses on requirements
	- Know when we're done 
	- Avoid *feature creep*

### Who is interested in the requirements document?
- Developers 
- The project manager
	- In charge of scheduling 
	- In charge of making sure goals are reached
- The client/customer 
	- Want to know what they're getting 
- Testers
	- Can be different from devs
	- What needs to be checked?

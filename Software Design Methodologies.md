## Methodologies For Designing Software

### Ad-Hoc
- Latin -> "To this"
- How you design Software if you're not thinking about the process

#### Steps
- Have ideas
- Write code
- See if it works
- Debug

#### Pros
- Saves time if it actually works!
- Good for small, quick prototypes
- *Low Overhead*

#### Cons
- Wasted time if it doesn't work
- Not scalable
- Not compatible 
- Less extendable/modifable
- **Teamwork is hard**
- Testing is going to be worse


### Formalized

#### Steps Shared Across Methodologies
**Write Documentation Throughout Process**
1) *Requirements*
	- What should software do?
2) *Design*
	- How should the software do it?
	- What language? Existing software? etc.
3) *Implementation*
	- Write the code!
	- Testing is in part written here
4) *Validation*
	- Run the tests
	- Evaluate requirements
	- Connect with user
5) *Release*
	- Make the code/software available
6) *Maintenance*
	- Make sure to update the software to keep it secure and modern
	- Bug fixes!


#### Waterfall Design Methodology

##### Process (Finish ALL of Each Step)
*See:* [[Software Design Methodologies#Steps Shared Across Methodologies]]
1) Step 1
2) Step 2
3) etc.

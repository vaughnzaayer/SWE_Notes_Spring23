*Providing inputs to your code and checking that the output is valid/expected*
- *input* and *output* can mean different things


## Why don't people test?
- Annoying/unfun?
- Extra work
- Clearly, MY code works!
- Testing is **hard**


## Why is testing hard?
- Combinatorial explosion
- Implementation details
- Corner cases
- Varying conditions
- Assumptions
- **COMPLETE TESTING** is impossible

"Testing shows the presence of bugs, not the absence of bugs" - *Dijkstra*


## What makes a good test?
- A good test is likely to find bugs

### Test Coverage
- Coverage of specifications ([[Black Box Testing]])
- Implementation coverage ([[White Box Testing]])

## Industry
- Wide range of jobs and job types you work with
	- Other people make communication and documentation very important
- Very important for software to be high quality, and *correct*
- Timeline driven/critical

## Academic
- Generally a smaller team than industry
- Software usually open source
- Tends to be smaller scale, more "proof of concept" ([[Software Design Methodologies#Prototyping |Prototypes]])
	- Showcase important features, don't sacrifice quality

## Hobby
- Smaller than academic groups, generally
- Correctness is less important
- Too much overhead slows down productivity, and can be unnecessary
- Ad-Hoc heavy ([[Software Design Methodologies#Ad-Hoc|Ad-Hoc]])

- Focus on what is used most

## Boundary Testing
- Special cases
- Intersections between equivalence classes 
	- ex. positive integers vs negative integers
- Off-by-one errors

### Equivalence Testing
- A representative element from group of inputs that you should expect to be bounded in the same way

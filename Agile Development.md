## Agile Development
**Note:** This sounds like [[Software Design Methodologies#Ad-Hoc |Ad-Hoc]]

- Big thing in industry like a decade ago
- Hard to do properly because it's very vague/loose

### Agile Manifesto
- Individuals and interactions are valuable over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following plans


## Extreme Programming

- New versions are built regularly
	- Sometimes multiple times a day
- Deliver new versions to the customer regularly
	- In industry, roughly every two weeks
- Run all the tests for every build, and only accept builds that pass the tests
- *Pair Programming* should be done all the time
	- Partner checks as you go along
- Everyone should own everything
- Documentation is less of a focus
- *Focus on Simplicity*, and make changes to support it

### Incremental Planning
- Focuses on a *story*
	- A particular use case
- Overtime/Overwork is very limited (Industry)
	- Known that these do not result in sustainable output
	- Best use of programmers is not wringing them out like sponges
- Customer interaction is critical, they're basically part of the design team
- *Refactoring*
	- When you notice ways to improve the software, make the changes
	- Including simplifying


## SCRUM
*It's called "scrumming"*

- Team Size: Small (Approx. 6-8 max)
	- *Pizza Rule*

- Roles
	- Development Team
	- Product Owner
	- SCRUM Master
		- Makes sure *nothing* distracts the Development Team
		- Line of communication in and out of the team for the developers

### Basic Steps

#### Planning Phase
- Outline goals, figure out what's important
- Less rigorous than [[Software Design Methodologies#Waterfall Design Methodology |Waterfall]]
- Design software architecture

#### Series of *Sprints*
- Cycles of *implementation* and *iteration*
- Usually 2 weeks to 30 days in length (short, manageable bursts)
- Start by choosing goals from the *product backlog*
	- *Product Backlog:* List of things that need to be done
	- Do not choose all of it - What's necessary? Unneeded? 
- At the end, there's a *sprint retrospective*
	- Tell the customer/people paying you about progress
	- What worked and what didn't?
	- The *sprint review* is the publication of your results (**Important**: Involves the customer)
- Daily meeting
	- Time-limited (approx. 15 min)
	- Talk about what you've done since the last meeting, and future plans/difficulties

#### Project Closure Phase
- Write documentation
- Package & release
- Review and retrospective

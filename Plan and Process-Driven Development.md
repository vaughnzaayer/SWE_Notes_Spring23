- Know what you're doing
- Be conscientious
- Documentation, scalability, modularity, etc.

**NOTE**: The following is *not* PP-D Development

## Agile Development
**Note:** This sounds like [[Software Design Methodologies#Ad-Hoc |Ad-Hoc]]

- Big thing in industry like a decade ago
- Hard to do properly because it's very vague/loose

### Agile Manifesto
- Individuals and interactions are valuable over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following plans


## Extreme Programming

- New versions are built regularly
	- Sometimes multiple times a day
- Deliver new versions to the customer regularly
	- In industry, roughly every two weeks
- Run all the tests for every build, and only accept builds that pass the tests
- *Pair Programming* should be done all the time
	- Partner checks as you go along
- Everyone should own everything
- Documentation is less of a focus
- *Focus on Simplicity*, and make changes to support it

### Incremental Planning
- Focuses on a *story*
	- A particular use case
- Overtime/Overwork is very limited (Industry)
	- Known that these do not result in sustainable output
	- Best use of programmers is not wringing them out like sponges
- Customer interaction is critical, they're basically part of the design team
- *Refactoring*
	- When you notice ways to improve the software, make the changes
	- Including simplifying
